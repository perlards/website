                    <p>I'm a computer science student at Boston University with a strong foundation in object-oriented programming, backend development, and systems-level debugging, complemented by a business minor that gives me a broader perspective on technology's real-world impact. Through my internship with the Seminole Tribe of Floridaâ€™s IT Department and personal projects in both backend and frontend development, I've developed practical skills in Python, Java, C, Assembly, and ServiceNow. I'm passionate about building reliable, user-centered software and excited to contribute to innovative engineering teams while continuing to grow in areas like mobile development, distributed systems, and UI design.</p>
